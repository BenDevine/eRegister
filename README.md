This project was working towards an assignment set for a Web Architectures module at Sheffield Hallam University 12/13.
It's used to show my understanding and thoughts on the following features:


Configuration management (How I used GIT)
Domain modelling  (Changing a simple class model to a MVC application)
Controller developmnet (setting up controllers)
RESTful web services 


Thoughts and feelings about this Project
=========================================
Although I learnt a great deal of things whilst working on my MVC application I also came across many problems. Working out how to solve these problems took a lot of time and although I overcame most problems the fact that I couldn't set up my database left my project half finished. However, I did do the nessesary steps towards making my application runnable by creating and completing both my domain classes and controllers. I felt as though I had a good go at this assignment and If I had a second chance I would aim to do the assignment in class at it would have saved numerous hours of trouble shooting to try and solve problems.
